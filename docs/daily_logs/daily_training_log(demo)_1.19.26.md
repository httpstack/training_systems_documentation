# DAILY TRAINING LOG
**Date:** 1-19-26
**Location:** Finance Dept
**Trainer:** Grace Simpson

================================
**PRIMARY FOCUS TODAY**
Asset Acquisition and Tagging (RF vs State ownership).

--------------------------------
**PROCESSES OBSERVED**
- Receiving a new microscope for Dr. Y's lab.
- Deciding which sticker (Decal) goes on it.
- Entering it into "RAMI" (their legacy system).

--------------------------------
**STEP-BY-STEP NOTES**
1. Box arrived. Grace checked the packing slip against the PO.
2. She looked at the "Fund Code" on the PO. It said "Federal Grant."
3. Because it was > $5,000 and Federal, she used a specific "RF" decal AND a "US Gov" decal.
4. We logged into RAMI.
5. She entered: Asset Description, Location, Cost, and "Surplus Ownership Code" (She typed 'R').
6. We had to scan the barcode.

--------------------------------
**DECISIONS MADE TODAY**
- **Decision:** Used "RF" Tag ending in "R" instead of "S".
- **Reason:** Grace said because the money came from a Federal Grant, title stays with RF, not the State.
- **Rule:** If cost > $5k AND Federal Funds = Capitalized Asset.

--------------------------------
**QUESTIONS / UNCLEAR ITEMS**
- Why do we have to manually type the PO number if it's already in the finance system? Can't we pull that?
- What happens if the microscope breaks next week? (Ask about "Disposition" tomorrow).
